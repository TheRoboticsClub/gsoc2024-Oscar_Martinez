# Summary

This week I continued solving bugs in the code needed for subtree composition. They were mainly related with state management and unwanted re-renders. 

# Memoizing components

This week, I consolidated different components I refactored in the previous weeks, ensuring proper state management to allow the subtree editor to work. 

I mainly [memoized](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) a lot of components so they don't re-render if the props have not changed. 

On top of that, I moved the state used in the editor to a wrapper component higher in the hierarchy. This allows this component to re-render without affecting the main editor.
