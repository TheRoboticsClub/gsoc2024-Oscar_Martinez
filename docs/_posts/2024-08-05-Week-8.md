# Summary

This week I finally solved all the bugs to make composition work, both in the frontend and in the backend. It took more than expected due to the complex implementation of the TreeEditor. Please, check the PR for all the details. 

![main_tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week8/main.png)

After the user clicks the subtree, the modal with the editor opens:

![subtree]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week8/subtree.png)

If the user now wanted to download the app, the backend would take care of merging all the trees into one so it can be executed.
