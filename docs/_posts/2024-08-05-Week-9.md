# Summary

Last week, I finished subtree composition with depth 1, and tested it extensively with offline applications. 

This week, I discovered that support for executing those same applications but in the [dockerized environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/jderobot/robotics-backend). 

I reorganized the code and made the [generate_dockerized_app](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/blob/713d2ebe8d6a89a9131e00afa62bdf059c4a2ca4/backend/tree_api/views.py#L937) work with composition. 

I also started thinking about the proper way to implement N-level composition, that is, subtrees that can contain other subtrees. I did some offline experiments mainly with the frontend.
