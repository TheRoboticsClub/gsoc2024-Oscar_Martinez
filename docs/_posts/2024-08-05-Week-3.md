# Summary

This week, I collaborated with the community to identify and resolve bugs, as well as review various pull requests. My primary contribution involved setting up a CI/CD pipeline to enforce a uniform code style and standardizing the frontend's interaction with both the Robotics Backend and the BT Studio backend.

# Style Pipeline

During my collaboration last week, I noticed that developers often introduced unnecessary diffs due to inconsistent code styles. As the project approaches maturity, it is becoming critical to address these issues.

After consulting with the developers, I configured two GitHub workflows: one for Python and another for JavaScript/JSX files.

For Python, we opted for the [Black Formatter](https://github.com/psf/black), a PEP8-compliant, opinionated code formatter. For JavaScript, we chose [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), one of the most widely adopted formatters in the industry. Currently, these pipelines are configured not to auto-format the code, as we believe that each developer should be responsible for writing code that adheres to the established style guidelines and familiarizing themselves with the formatting conventions.

# Refactoring with Async Functions

The BT Studio frontend had been increasingly relying on complex promise chains to manage communications with the Robotics Backend and the *tree_api*. To improve this, I proposed refactoring the codebase to utilize [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). By allowing the use of the `await` keyword, async functions enable more readable and maintainable code, effectively handling asynchronous operations with cleaner promise-based behavior.

# Subtrees in PyTrees

This week, I also began exploring how to integrate subtrees into *PyTrees*, the Behavior Tree library used in BT Studio. In BT Studio, the graphical diagram is converted from JSON to XML, which is then parsed and executed by the *tree_gardener* library. This library constructs the trees as BehaviorTree objects within the *PyTrees* framework. I discovered that *PyTrees* provides [methods](https://py-trees.readthedocs.io/en/devel/modules.html#module-py_trees.trees) for inserting subtrees and performing various tree operations. I have started conducting offline tests to better understand and implement these features. I discussed with my mentors to make some offline demos for next week.
