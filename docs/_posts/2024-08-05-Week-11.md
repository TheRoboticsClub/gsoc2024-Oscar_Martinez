# Summary

This week, I resolved the issues identified in the backend to enable multilevel composition. I also began developing a basic library of reusable behaviors that users can easily import into their projects.

# Multilevel composition in the backend

## Storing subtrees also as XML

First, I changed a little how the subtree XML files were being managed. Now, when the user creates (or saves) a subtree, it is not only stored as JSON: an XML version is also created and stored. Before, this tree was only generated on app generation time and never stored. This new behavior has two main advantages: 

1. All the info of the subtrees of the project is ready when the user want to generate an app. 
2. The subtree implementation can easily be checked and debugged. 

## Recursive subtree substitution

Previously, tree generation only checked for subtrees at the first level. I [expanded its functionality](https://github.com/JdeRobot/bt-studio/blob/713d2ebe8d6a89a9131e00afa62bdf059c4a2ca4/backend/tree_api/tree_generator.py#L135) to iterate over the generated XML until no subtrees remain.

This is done by comparing the XML tags against a list of possible subtrees, which can conveniently be obtained by just listing all files in the subtree subdirectory.

# Basic library of behaviors

With the composition tools fully functional, I created four basic subtrees that can be useful across a wide range of robotic applications. The goal is for users to import the ones they need and begin working from a solid foundation. In the future, this library could grow to include a variety of community-created behaviors, organized into different categories.

The created behaviors are:

* AlignPerson: allows a robot with a person using images
* DistanceWatcher: checks if the robot is at a given instance to an obstacle.
* FollowPerson: reactively follows a person using images
* MoveAvoidingObstacles: the robot goes straight until it finds an obstacle, then it tries to find the nearest clear space.

I expanded the tree creation endpoints so that when a user enters the name of an existing behavior, it is imported from the library instead of creating a new blank subtree. This includes both the JSON and the XML files.
