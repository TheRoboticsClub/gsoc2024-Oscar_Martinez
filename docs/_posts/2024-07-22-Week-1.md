# Summary

BT Studio is a web-based IDE designed for developing robotics applications using behavior trees, which are an increasingly popular method for organizing robot behaviors in a modular fashion. This week, I familiarized myself with the installation process of the tool and tested various example applications, during which I identified and reported several bugs. I also studied some literature about behavior trees. 

# BT Studio Structure

BT Studio's frontend is built using React and is divided into three main components: a file browser, a file editor, and a tree diagram editor. Users can create Python actions using the file browser and editor, utilizing the `py_trees` library by Daniel Stohnier. Once the actions are defined, a behavior tree (BT) can be visually created and modified through the graphical editor using the available actions. The editor supports all flow control and decorator blocks from Davide Faconti's `BT.cpp` library, including features like `ReactiveFallback`. Once an application is completed, it can be downloaded and executed within a ROS 2 environment.

The frontend interacts with BT Studio's Django backend, known as *tree_api*, via a REST API. This API provides functionality such as file storage and JSON-to-XML translation for the diagrams.

# My GSoC Project

During my GSoC project, I will expand BT Studio’s capabilities to support sub-trees, enhancing the tool's modularity and overall functionality. This will involve developing new *tree_api* endpoints and React components to provide the necessary composition tools. Additionally, I will create a library of popular robotic behaviors (e.g., person recognition) that can be reused through the composition tools.
