# Final week

This week, I focused on wrapping up everything. I resolved the final bugs in multilevel composition and thoroughly tested the library’s subtrees. I also engaged in community bonding, discussing next steps and my overall GSoC experience with other contributors.

To ensure consistency, I verified that multilevel composition works seamlessly within the Dockerized execution environment, matching the behavior of the offline app generation endpoint.

Using the library’s subtrees, I created a video to showcase my GSoC contributions. In the video, I demonstrate multilevel composition and build an example application to highlight the tool’s capabilities. I also contributed to promotional content for Twitter and LinkedIn.

I'm proud to say that all my contributions got merged! It's been an incredible time working with the community to improve BT Studio and help people develop powerful robotic applications with ease.
